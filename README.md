# Pands-Project

**Version 1.0.0**

## Description
This project contains an analysis of the Fisher's Iris Data Set. The analysis is done by using plots and statistical measures in Python. 

## Background
The Iris Data Set was created by R.A. Fisher and it is called the best well known data set with no missing values. It contains the data for 3 classes of Iris Flowers of 50 instances each.

## A list of items in the Pands-Project:
1. Fisher's Iris Data Set
2. Analysis of this data using Python as an analysis tool:
    1. Reading the Iris Data Set
    2. Summary of the Iris Data Set
    3. Data visualisation using different plots
        - histogram
        - boxplots
        - scatters
        - violiplots
    4. Statistical measures of The Iris Data Set
    Statistical Measures are a technique of descriptive analysis used to give a summary of the characteristics of a data set. Measures of central tendency describe some key characteristics of the data set based on the average or middle values, as they describe the centre of the data.

## How to use these:
1. Go to each individual code (from 1 to 4)
2. In code nr 1 "readingdata.py" and nr 2 "summaryofdata" sipmly run these codes in Python and the tables will print there
3. In codes nr 3 simply run these codes in Python and plots will show up automatically as png files
4. In code nr 4 "statistics.py", similar like in code nr 1 and 2, simply run this code and the tables will appear in Python

## How to analyse Data with Python:
1. Ask the right questions
2. Data collection
3. Summarise the Data
4. Analysing the Data using Plots
5. Analysing the Data using Statistics
6. Results interpretation
