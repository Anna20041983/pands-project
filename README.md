# Pands-Project

**Version 1.0.0**

## Description
This project contains an analysis of the Fisher's Iris Data Set. The analysis is done by using plots and statistical measures in Python. 

## A list of items in the Pands-Project:
1. Fisher's Iris Data Set
2. Analysis of this data using Python as an analysis tool:
    1. Reading the Iris Data Set
    2. Summary of the Iris Data Set
    3. Data visualisation using different plots
        - histogram
        - boxplots
        - scatters
        - violiplots
    4. Statistical measures of The Iris Data Set
    Statistical Measures are a technique of descriptive analysis used to give a summary of the characteristics of a data set. Measures of central tendency describe some key characteristics of the data set based on the average or middle values, as they describe the centre of the data.

## How to analyse Data with Python:
1. Ask the right questions
2. Data collection
3. Summarise the Data
4. Analysing the Data using Plots
5. Analysing the Data using Statistics
6. Results interpretation
